# Calculator Backend Service

## Overview
The Calculator Backend Service is a robust Node.js application built with Express.js, designed to perform arithmetic calculations and persistently store the history of these operations. It leverages MongoDB for data storage and EJS for dynamic server-side rendering of web pages.

## Features
-   **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   **Calculation History**: Stores each calculation (expression and result) linked to a specific user in a MongoDB database.
-   **User-Specific History Retrieval**: Allows users to view their past calculations.
-   **Web Interface**: Provides a simple web-based user interface using EJS templates for performing calculations and viewing history.
-   **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Mongoose ODM for seamless interaction with MongoDB.
-   **Structured Logging**: Employs a custom logger for organized console output.

## Technologies Used
| Technology    | Description                                       |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `Node.js`     | JavaScript runtime for server-side execution.     |
| `Express.js`  | Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework.    |
| `MongoDB`     | NoSQL database for flexible data storage.         |
| `Mongoose`    | MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.   |
| `EJS`         | Embedded JavaScript templating for server-side rendering. |
| `dotenv`      | Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.   |
| `body-parser` | Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware.   |
| `Nodemon`     | Automatically restarts the Node.js application during development. |

## Getting Started

### Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:David-EA/calculator-app.git
    cd calculator-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following variables:
```dotenv
PORT=8000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/calculator_db
```
*   `PORT`: The port on which the Express server will run.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your MongoDB database.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the Calculator Backend Service through its web interface:

1.  **Start the Server**:
    To run the application in development mode (with Nodemon for auto-restarts):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or, for a production build:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start at `http://localhost:[PORT]`.

2.  **Access the Calculator**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT]`. You will be presented with a simple calculator interface.

3.  **Perform a Calculation**:
    *   Enter a `username` (e.g., `testuser`).
    *   Input the first number in the `num1` field.
    *   Select an `operation` (+, -, \*, /) from the dropdown.
    *   Input the second number in the `num2` field.
    *   Click the "Calculate" button.
    The result will be displayed on the page, and the calculation will be saved to the database under the specified username.

4.  **View Calculation History**:
    On the main calculator page, click the "View History" link. This will redirect you to a page displaying all calculations previously performed by the entered username. If no username was entered or if no history exists for that user, a corresponding message will be displayed.
